# MIPS Soft Microprocessor

CPE 300 final project at UNLV Spring 2016

## Description
The purpose of this project was to implement a complete multicycle MIPS microprocessor in Verilog HDL that can execute a given instruction set.  This microprocessor can execute 1-byte and 2-byte instructions, perform basic arithmetic and looping instructions, and read from and write to memory.  It is based on the given multicycle datapath schematic, as well as the processors detailed in the course lectures, lab assignments, and the book *Digital Design and Computer Architecture (2nd ed.)* by David Money Harris and Sarah L. Harris.
